# configfiles
My poorly made and barely functional config files .**rc files and stuff...


.fvwmrc - This file I got it from the samples provided in the standard OpenBSD installation in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm/ the file is mostly unmodified aside from a few chances in the menus, buttons and keybindings so I could get it working in the way I wanted. currently Ctrl+arrows => navigate through panes, Ctrl+shit+arrows => move cursor, Ctrl+esc=> open window menu for active window(options like maximize,, raise, lower, iconify etc...) Alt+tab=> open a list of open windows from which you can chose by using up and down arrows and select with Enter.
